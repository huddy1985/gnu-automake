# We expect the following diagnostic:

# Makefile.am:19: the following conditions:
# Makefile.am:19:   COND3_FALSE
# Makefile.am:19:   COND1_FALSE COND2_FALSE
# Makefile.am:19:   COND1_FALSE COND2_TRUE
# Makefile.am:19: Either define `B' in these conditions, or use
# Makefile.am:19: `+=' in the same conditions as the definitions.
#
# It would be nice if Automake could print only COND3_FALSE and
# COND1_FALSE (merging the last two conditions), so we'll support
# this case in the check too.

# Are COND3_FALSE and COND1_FALSE mentioned?
